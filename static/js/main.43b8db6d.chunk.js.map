It was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. Its name is Latin for twins, and it is associated with the twins Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology. \r\n\r\n<h2>Location</h2>\r\n\r\nGemini lies between Taurus to the west and Cancer to the east, with Auriga and Lynx to the north, Monoceros and Canis Minor to the south, and Orion to the south - west.\r\n\r\nIn classical antiquity, Cancer was the location of the Sun on the northern solstice (June 21). During the first century AD, axial precession shifted it into Gemini. In 1990, the location of the Sun at the northern solstice moved from Gemini into Taurus, where it will remain until the 27th century AD and then move into Aries. The Sun will move through Gemini from June 21 to July 20 through 2062.\r\n\r\nGemini is prominent in the winter skies of the northern Hemisphere and is visible the entire night in December to January. The easiest way to locate the constellation is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar V - shaped asterism (the open cluster Hyades) of Taurus and the three stars of Orion's Belt (Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka). Another way is to mentally draw a line from the Pleiades star cluster located in Taurus and the brightest star in Leo, Regulus. In doing so, an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic is drawn, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon moves through Gemini, its motion can easily be observed in a single night as it appears first west of Castor and Pollux, then aligns, and finally appears east of them.\r\n\r\n<h2>Stars</h2>\r\nThe constellation contains 85 stars of naked eye visibility.\r\n\r\nThe brightest star in Gemini is Pollux, and the second - brightest is Castor. Castor's Bayer designation as \"Alpha\" arose because Johann Bayer did not carefully distinguish which of the two was the brighter when he assigned his eponymous designations in 1603. Although the characters of myth are twins, the actual stars are physically very different from each other.\r\n`,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 2,\r\n    name: \"Unforseeable Future\",\r\n    points: 2,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that they were unpredictable.</i></div>),\r\n    answer: \"Random number generation\",\r\n    article:`\r\nRandom number generation is a process by which, often by means of a random number generator (RNG), a sequence of numbers or symbols is generated that cannot be reasonably predicted better than by random chance. This means that the particular outcome sequence will contain some patterns detectable in hindsight but impossible to foresee. True random number generators can be hardware random - number generators (HRNGs), wherein each generation is a function of the current value of a physical environment's attribute that is constantly changing in a manner that is practically impossible to model. This would be in contrast to so - called \"random number generations\" done by pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs), which generate numbers that only look random but are in fact predetermined - these generations can be reproduced simply by knowing the state of the PRNG.\r\n\r\nVarious applications of randomness have led to the development of different methods for generating random data. Some of these have existed since ancient times, including well - known examples like the rolling of dice, coin flipping, the shuffling of playing cards, the use of yarrow stalks (for divination) in the I Ching, as well as countless other techniques. Because of the mechanical nature of these techniques, generating large quantities of sufficiently random numbers (important in statistics) required much work and time. Thus, results would sometimes be collected and distributed as random number tables.\r\n\r\n<h2>Practical</h2>  <h2>applications</h2>  <h2>and</h2>  <h2>uses</h2> \r\n\r\nRandom number generators have applications in gambling, statistical sampling, computer simulation, cryptography, completely randomized design, and other areas where producing an unpredictable result is desirable. Generally, in applications having unpredictability as the paramount feature, such as in security applications, hardware generators are generally preferred over pseudorandom algorithms, where feasible.\r\n\r\nPseudorandom number generators are very useful in developing Monte Carlo - method simulations, as debugging is facilitated by the ability to run the same sequence of random numbers again by starting from the same random seed. They are also used in cryptography - so long as the seed is secret. The sender and receiver can generate the same set of numbers automatically to use as keys.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 3,\r\n    name: \"Connections\",\r\n    points: 2,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that it connected 2 things.</i></div>),\r\n    answer: \"Golden Gate Bridge\",\r\n    article: `\r\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate, the one - mile - wide (1.6 km) strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean in California, United States. The structure links San Francisco - the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula - to Marin County, carrying both U.S. Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. It also carries pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and is designated as part of U.S. Bicycle Route 95. Recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers as one of the Wonders of the Modern World, the bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a fixed link between San Francisco and Marin had gained increasing popularity during the late 19th century, but it was not until the early 20th century that such a link became feasible. Joseph Strauss served as chief engineer for the project, with Leon Moisseiff, Irving Morrow and Charles Ellis making significant contributions to its design. The bridge opened to the public on May 27, 1937, and has undergone various retrofits and other improvement projects in the decades since.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Gate Bridge is described in Frommer's travel guide as \"possibly the most beautiful, certainly the most photographed, bridge in the world.\" At the time of its opening in 1937, it was both the longest and the tallest suspension bridge in the world, titles it held until 1964 and 1998 respectively. Its main span is 4,200 feet (1,280 m) and its total height is 746 feet (227 m).\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n\r\nBefore the bridge was built, the only practical short route between San Francisco and what is now Marin County was by boat across a section of San Francisco Bay. A ferry service began as early as 1820, with a regularly scheduled service beginning in the 1840s for the purpose of transporting water to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n<h2>Navigational</h2> <h2>Aid</h2>\r\n\r\nThe Golden Gate Bridge's first aircraft warning lights used rotating aerobeacons at the top of the towers that flashed red. In the 1980s, the present - day 750 - watt red lamps were put into service, along with 16 red outline lanterns on the cables to enhance the structure's visibility at night. For maritime movement, the bridge has white and green navigation lights on both sides at the midspan and red safety lights marking the south tower's fender.\r\n\r\n<h2>Foghorns</h2>\r\nCommonly, particularly during the summer months, fog on the strait becomes so dense that it can fully obscure the whole bridge, creating an even greater hazard for mariners. A system of five foghorns was thus set up on the bridge in 1937 and remains operational to this day. The fog signals are air - powered and are manually switched on and off. Coast Guard regulates the pattern and pitch by which the horns must sound.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 4,\r\n    name: \"Choices\",\r\n    points: 3,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that they had to make a tough choice.</i></div>),\r\n    answer: \"Trolley Problem\",\r\n    article: `\r\nThe trolley problem is a series of thought experiments in ethics, psychology and artificial intelligence involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway trolley (tram) or train is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the railway track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life - and - death dilemmas (medical, judicial, etc.) are posed, each containing the option either to do nothing - in which case several people will be killed - or to intervene and sacrifice one initially \"safe\" person to save the others.\r\n\r\nOpinions on the ethics of each scenario turn out to be sensitive to details of the story that may seem immaterial to the abstract dilemma. The question of formulating a general principle that can account for the differing judgments arising in different variants of the story was raised in 1967 as part of an analysis of debates on abortion and the doctrine of double effect by the English philosopher Philippa Foot. Later dubbed \"the trolley problem\" by Judith Jarvis Thomson in a 1976 article that catalyzed a large literature, the subject refers to the meta - problem of why different judgements are arrived at in particular instances.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2001, the trolley problem and its variants have been used in empirical research on moral psychology. It has been a topic of popular books. Trolley - style scenarios also arise in discussing the ethics of autonomous vehicle design, which may require programming to choose whom or what to strike when a collision appears to be unavoidable. More recently, the trolley problem has also become an Internet meme.\r\n\r\nA utilitarian view asserts that it is obligatory to steer to the track with one man on it. According to classical utilitarianism, such a decision would be not only permissible, but, morally speaking, the better option (than other option being no action at all). This fact makes diverting the trolley obligatory. An alternative viewpoint is that since moral wrongs are already in place in the situation, moving to another track constitutes a participation in the moral wrong, making one partially responsible for the death when otherwise no one would be responsible. An opponent of action may also point to the incommensurability of human lives. Under some interpretations of moral obligation, simply being present in this situation and being able to influence its outcome constitutes an obligation to participate. If this is the case, then doing nothing would be considered an immoral act.\r\n\r\n<h2>Survey Data</h2>\r\n\r\nThe trolley problem has been the subject of many surveys in which about 90% of respondents have chosen to kill the one and save the five. If the situation is modified where the one sacrificed for the five was a relative or romantic partner, respondents are much less likely to be willing to sacrifice the one life.\r\n\r\nA 2009 survey by David Bourget and David Chalmers shows that 68% of professional philosophers would switch (sacrifice the one individual to save five lives) in the case of the trolley problem, 8% would not switch, and the remaining 24% had another view or could not answer.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 5,\r\n    name: \"Rat-powered\",\r\n    points: 3,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that it was powered by rats.</i></div>),\r\n    answer: \"Black Death\",\r\n    article: `\r\nThe Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic that occurred in Europe from 1346 to 1353. It was one of the most fatal pandemics in human history; as many as 50 million people perished, perhaps 50% of Europe's 14th century population. The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and spread by fleas and through the air. One of the most significant events in European history, the Black Death had far - reaching population, economic, and cultural impacts. It was the beginning of the second plague pandemic. The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound effects on the course of European history.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Black Death is disputed. Genetic analysis suggests Yersinia pestis bacteria evolved approximately 7,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Neolithic, with flea - mediated strains emerging around 3,800 years ago during the late Bronze Age. The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remain unclear, with some evidence pointing towards Central Asia, China, the Middle East, and Europe. The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347. From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, West Asia, and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily, and the Italian Peninsula. There is evidence that once it came ashore, the Black Death mainly spread from person - to - person as pneumonic plague, thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic, which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague. In 2022, it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s; when combined with genetic evidence, this implies that the initial spread may have been unrelated to the 14th century Mongol conquests previously postulated as the cause.\r\n\r\nThe Black Death was the second great natural disaster to strike Europe during the Late Middle Ages (the first one being the Great Famine of 1315 - 1317) and is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of the European population, as well as approximately 33% of the population of the Middle East. There were further outbreaks throughout the Late Middle Ages and, also due to other contributing factors (the crisis of the late Middle Ages), the European population did not regain its 14th century level until the 16th century. Outbreaks of the plague recurred around the world until the early 19th century.\r\n\r\n<h2>Lack</h2>  <h2>of</h2>  <h2>Hygiene</h2>\r\n\r\nThe importance of hygiene was not recognized until the 19th century and the germ theory of disease. Until then streets were usually unhygienic, with live animals and human parasites facilitating the spread of transmissible disease.\r\n\r\nBy the early 14th century, so much filth had collected inside urban Europe that French and Italian cities were naming streets after human waste. In medieval Paris, several street names were inspired by merde, the French word for \"shit\". There were rue Merdeux, rue Merdelet, rue Merdusson, rue des Merdons and rue Merdiere - as well as a rue du Pipi. Pigs, cattle, chickens, geese, goats and horses roamed the streets of medieval London and Paris.\r\n\r\n<h2>European</h2>  <h2>outbreak</h2>\r\n\r\nPlague was reportedly first introduced to Europe via Genoese traders from their port city of Kaffa in the Crimea in 1347. During a protracted siege of the city in 1345 - 1346, the Mongol Golden Horde army of Jani Beg - whose mainly Tatar troops were suffering from the disease - catapulted infected corpses over the city walls of Kaffa to infect the inhabitants, though it is also likely that infected rats travelled across the siege lines to spread the epidemic to the inhabitants. As the disease took hold, Genoese traders fled across the Black Sea to Constantinople, where the disease first arrived in Europe in summer 1347.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 6,\r\n    name: \"Preservation\",\r\n    points: 4,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that preservation was crucial.</i></div>),\r\n    answer: \"Smoking (cooking)\",\r\n    article: `\r\nSmoking is the process of flavoring, browning, cooking, or preserving food, particularly meat, fish and tea, by exposing it to smoke from burning or smoldering material, most often wood.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, alder is the traditional smoking wood, but oak is more often used now, and beech to a lesser extent. In North America, hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, alder, maple, and fruit tree woods, such as apple, cherry, and plum, are commonly used for smoking. Other biomass besides wood can also be employed, sometimes with the addition of flavoring ingredients. Chinese tea - smoking uses a mixture of uncooked rice, sugar, and tea, heated at the base of a wok.\r\n\r\nSome North American ham and bacon makers smoke their products over burning corncobs. Peat is burned to dry and smoke the barley malt used to make Scotch whisky and some beers. In New Zealand, sawdust from the native manuka (tea tree) is commonly used for hot - smoking fish. In Iceland, dried sheep dung is used to cold - smoke fish, lamb, mutton, and whale.\r\n\r\nHistorically, farms in the Western world included a small building termed the \"smokehouse\", where meats could be smoked and stored. This was generally well separated from other buildings both because of fire danger and smoke emanations. The smoking of food may possibly introduce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which may lead to an increased risk of some types of cancer; however, this association is still being debated.\r\n\r\nSmoking can be done in four ways: cold smoking, warm smoking, hot smoking, and through the employment of a smoke flavoring, such as liquid smoke. However, these methods of imparting smoke only affect the food surface, and are unable to preserve food, thus, smoking is paired with other microbial hurdles, such as chilling and packaging, to extend food shelf - life.\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>\r\n\r\nThe smoking of food likely dates back to the Paleolithic era. This process was later combined with pre - curing the food in salt or salty brine, resulting in a remarkably effective preservation process that was adapted and developed by numerous cultures around the world. Until the modern era, smoking was of a more \"heavy duty\" nature as the main goal was to preserve the food. Large quantities of salt were used in the curing process and smoking times were quite long, sometimes involving days of exposure.\r\n\r\n<h2>Hot</h2>  <h2>smoking</h2>\r\n\r\nHot smoking cooks foods and simultaneously flavors them with smoke in a controlled environment such as a smoker oven or smokehouse. It requires consistent control of both the temperature of the food and the amount of smoke being applied to it. Some smokers have a heat source built into them, while others use the heat from a stove - top or oven. Like cold smoking, the item may be hung first to develop a pellicle; it is then smoked from 1 hour to as long as 24 hours. Although foods that have been hot smoked are often reheated or further cooked, they are typically safe to eat without further cooking. The temperature range for hot smoking is usually between 52 and 80 C (126 and 176 F). Foods smoked in this temperature range are usually fully cooked, but still moist and flavorful. At smoker temperatures hotter than 85 C (185 F), foods can shrink excessively, buckle, or even split. Smoking at high temperatures also reduces yield, as both moisture and fat are cooked away.\r\n\r\n<h2>Smoke</h2>  <h2>roasting</h2>\r\n\r\nSmoke - roasting refers to any process that has the attributes of both roasting and smoking. This smoking method is sometimes referred to as barbecuing or pit - roasting. It may be done in a smoke - roaster, a closed wood - fired oven, or a barbecue pit, any smoker that can reach above 121 C (250 F), or in a conventional oven by placing a pan filled with hardwood chips on the floor of the oven so that the chips can smolder and produce a smoke - bath. In North America, this smoking method is commonly referred to as \"barbecuing\", \"pit baking\", or \"pit roasting\".\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 7,\r\n    name: \"Foundational framework\",\r\n    points: 4,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that it was a foundational framework.</i></div>),\r\n    answer: \"History of the United States Constitution\",\r\n    article: `\r\nThe United States Constitution has served as the supreme law of the United States since taking effect in 1789. The document was written at the 1787 Philadelphia Convention and was ratified through a series of state conventions held in 1787 and 1788. Since 1789, the Constitution has been amended twenty - seven times; particularly important amendments include the ten amendments of the United States Bill of Rights, the three Reconstruction Amendments, and the Nineteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution grew out of efforts to reform the Articles of Confederation, an earlier constitution which provided for a loose alliance of states with a weak central government. From May 1787 through September 1787, delegates from twelve of the thirteen states convened in Philadelphia, where they wrote a new constitution. Two alternative plans were developed at the convention. The nationalist majority, soon to be called \"Federalists\", put forth the Virginia Plan, a consolidated government based on proportional representation among the states by population. The \"old patriots\", later called \"Anti - Federalists\", advocated the New Jersey Plan, a purely federal proposal, based on providing each state with equal representation. The Connecticut Compromise allowed for both plans to work together. Other controversies developed regarding slavery and a Bill of Rights in the original document.  \r\n\r\nThe drafted Constitution was submitted to the Congress of the Confederation in September 1787; that same month it approved the forwarding of the Constitution as drafted to the states, each of which would hold a ratification convention. The Federalist Papers, were published in newspapers while the states were debating ratification, which provided background and justification for the Constitution. Some states agreed to ratify the Constitution only if the amendments that were to become the Bill of Rights would be taken up immediately by the new government. In September 1788, the Congress of the Confederation certified that eleven states had ratified the new Constitution, and chose dates for federal elections and the transition to the new constitution on March 4, 1789. The new government began on March 4, 1789, with eleven states assembled in New York City. North Carolina waited to ratify the Constitution until after the Bill of Rights was passed by the new Congress, and Rhode Island's ratification would only come after a threatened trade embargo.\r\n\r\nIn 1791, the states ratified the Bill of Rights, which established protections for various civil liberties. The Bill of Rights initially only applied to the federal government, but following a process of incorporation most protections of the Bill of Rights now apply to state governments. Further amendments to the Constitution have addressed federal relationships, election procedures, terms of office, expanding the electorate, financing the federal government, consumption of alcohol, and congressional pay. Between 1865 and 1870, the states ratified the Reconstruction Amendments, which abolished slavery, guaranteed equal protection of the law, and implemented prohibitions on the restriction of voter rights. The meaning of the Constitution is interpreted by judicial review in the federal courts. The original parchment copies are on display at the National Archives Building.\r\n\r\n<h2>Declaration</h2>  <h2>of</h2>  <h2>Independence</h2>\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 1776, a resolution was introduced in the Second Continental Congress declaring the union with Great Britain to be dissolved, proposing the formation of foreign alliances, and suggesting the drafting of a plan of confederation to be submitted to the respective states. Independence was declared on July 4, 1776; the preparation of a plan of confederation was postponed. Although the Declaration was a statement of principles, it did not create a government or even a framework for how politics would be carried out. It was the Articles of Confederation that provided the necessary structure to the new nation during and after the American Revolution. The Declaration, however, did set forth the ideas of natural rights and the social contract that would help form the foundation of constitutional government.\r\n\r\nThe era of the Declaration of Independence is sometimes called the \"Continental Congress\" period. John Adams famously estimated as many as one - third of those resident in the original thirteen colonies were patriots. Scholars such as Gordon Wood describe how Americans were caught up in the Revolutionary fervor and excitement of creating governments, societies, a new nation on the face of the earth by rational choice as Thomas Paine declared in Common Sense.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 8,\r\n    name: \"Slim\",\r\n    points: 5,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that it was not fat.</i><br/><br/>A hint is available at a cost of 2 points.</div>),\r\n    answer: \"Leaning Tower of Pisa\",\r\n    article: `\r\nThe Leaning Tower of Pisa, or simply the Tower of Pisa (torre di Pisa), is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of Pisa Cathedral. It is known for its nearly four - degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The tower is one of three structures in Pisa's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), which includes the cathedral and Pisa Baptistry. Over time, the tower has become one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world as well as an architectural icon of Italy, receiving over 5 million visitors each year.\r\n\r\nThe height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183 feet 3 inches) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 m (185 ft 11 in) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 tonnes (16,000 short tons). The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north - facing staircase.\r\n\r\nThe tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight. It worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990, the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees. The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.\r\n\r\n<h2>History</h2>  <h2>following</h2>  <h2>Construction</h2>\r\n\r\nNumerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.\r\n\r\nStarting in 1993, 870 tonnes of lead counterweights were added, which straightened the tower slightly.\r\n\r\nThe tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989. The bells were removed to relieve some weight, and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away, and residences in the path of a potential collapse were vacated. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by removing 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) of soil from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years. In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.\r\n\r\nAfter a phase (1990 - 2001) of structural strengthening, the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain. In May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 9,\r\n    name: \"Division\",\r\n    points: 6,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that it could have strange implications when moving around.</i><br/><br/>A hint is available at a cost of 2 points.</div>),\r\n    answer: \"International Date Line\",\r\n    article: `\r\nThe International Date Line (IDL) is the line extending between the South and North Poles that is the boundary between one calendar day and the next. It passes through the Pacific Ocean, roughly following the 180° line of longitude and deviating to pass around some territories and island groups. Crossing the date line eastbound decreases the date by one day, while crossing the date line westbound increases the date.\r\n\r\nThe line is a cartographic convention and is not defined by international law. This has made it difficult for cartographers to agree on its precise course and has allowed countries through whose waters it passes to move it at times for their convenience.\r\n\r\n<h2>Description</h2>\r\n\r\nThe IDL is roughly based on the meridian of 180° longitude, roughly down the middle of the Pacific Ocean, and halfway around the world from the IERS Reference Meridian, the successor to the historic Greenwich prime meridian running through the Royal Greenwich Observatory. In many places, the IDL follows the 180° meridian exactly. In other places, however, the IDL deviates east or west away from that meridian. These various deviations generally accommodate the political and economic affiliations of the affected areas.\r\n\r\nProceeding from north to south, the first deviation of the IDL from 180° is to pass to the east of Wrangel Island and the Chukchi Peninsula, the easternmost part of Russian Siberia.  It then passes through the Bering Strait between the Diomede Islands at a distance of 1.5 kilometres (0.93 mi) from each island at 168°58'37\" W. It then bends considerably west of 180°, passing west of St. Lawrence Island and St. Matthew Island.\r\n\r\nThe IDL crosses between the U.S. Aleutian Islands (Attu Island being the westernmost) and the Commander Islands, which belong to Russia. It then bends southeast again to return to 180°. Thus, all of Russia is to the west of the IDL, and all of the United States is to the east except for the insular areas of Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island, reaching the hypothetical, but not used UTC- 13: 00 time zone.\r\n\r\nThe IDL remains on the 180° meridian until passing the equator. Two U.S. owned uninhabited atolls, Howland Island and Baker Island, just north of the equator in the central Pacific Ocean (and ships at sea between 172.5°W and 180°), have the earliest time on Earth (UTC- 12: 00 hours).\r\n\r\nThe IDL circumscribes Kiribati by swinging far to the east, almost reaching the 150°W meridian. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands south of Hawaii, have the latest time on Earth (UTC+ 14: 00 hours).\r\n\r\nSouth of Kiribati, the IDL returns westward but remains east of 180°, passing between Samoa and American Samoa. Accordingly, Samoa, Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, Fiji, Tonga, Tuvalu, and New Zealand's Kermadec Islands and Chatham Islands are all west of the IDL and have the same date. American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Niue, and French Polynesia are east of the IDL and one day behind.\r\n\r\nThe IDL then bends southwest to return to 180°. It follows that meridian until reaching Antarctica, which has multiple time zones.

He rents a bungalow in the Long Island village of West Egg, next to a luxurious estate inhabited by Jay Gatsby, an enigmatic multi - millionaire who hosts dazzling soirées yet does not partake in them.\r\n\r\nOne evening, Nick dines with a distant cousin, Daisy Buchanan, in the old money town of East Egg. Daisy is married to Tom Buchanan, formerly a Yale football star whom Nick knew during his college days. The couple has recently relocated from Chicago to a mansion directly across the bay from Gatsby's estate. There, Nick encounters Jordan Baker, an insolent flapper and golf champion who is a childhood friend of Daisy's. Jordan confides to Nick that Tom keeps a mistress, who brazenly telephones him at his home and lives in the \"valley of ashes\", a sprawling refuse dump. That evening, Nick sees Gatsby standing alone on his lawn, staring at a green light across the bay.\r\n\r\nDays later, Nick reluctantly accompanies a drunken and agitated Tom to New York City by train. En route, they stop at a garage inhabited by mechanic George Wilson and his wife - and Tom's mistress - Myrtle. Myrtle joins them, and the trio proceeds to a small New York apartment that Tom has rented for trysts with her. Guests arrive and a party ensues, which ends with Tom slapping Myrtle and breaking her nose after she mentions Daisy.\r\n\r\nOne morning, Nick receives a formal invitation to a party at Gatsby's mansion. Once there, Nick is embarrassed that he recognizes no one and begins drinking heavily until he encounters Jordan. While chatting with her, he is approached by a man who introduces himself as Jay Gatsby and insists that both he and Nick served in the 3rd Infantry Division during the war. Gatsby attempts to ingratiate himself with Nick and when Nick leaves the party, he notices Gatsby watching him.\r\n\r\nIn late July, Nick and Gatsby have lunch at a speakeasy. Gatsby tries impressing Nick with tales of his war heroism and his Oxford days. Afterward, Nick meets Jordan again at the Plaza Hotel. Jordan reveals that Gatsby and Daisy met around 1917 when Gatsby was an officer in the American Expeditionary Forces. They fell in love, but when Gatsby was deployed overseas, Daisy reluctantly married Tom. Gatsby hopes that his newfound wealth and dazzling parties will make Daisy reconsider. Gatsby uses Nick to stage a reunion with Daisy, and the two embark upon an affair.\r\n\r\nIn September, Tom discovers the affair when Daisy carelessly addresses Gatsby with unabashed intimacy in front of him. Later, at a Plaza Hotel suite, Gatsby and Tom argue about the affair. Gatsby insists Daisy declare that she never loved Tom. Daisy claims she loves Tom and Gatsby, upsetting both. Tom reveals Gatsby is a swindler whose money comes from bootlegging alcohol. Upon hearing this, Daisy chooses to stay with Tom. Tom scornfully tells Gatsby to drive her home, knowing that Daisy will never leave him.\r\n\r\nWhile returning to East Egg, Gatsby and Daisy drive by Wilson's garage and their car strikes Myrtle, killing her instantly. Later Gatsby reveals to Nick that Daisy was driving the car, but that he intends to take the blame for the accident to protect her. Nick urges Gatsby to flee to avoid prosecution, but he refuses. After Tom tells George that Gatsby owns the car that struck Myrtle, a distraught George assumes the owner of the vehicle must be Myrtle's lover. George fatally shoots Gatsby in his mansion's swimming pool, then kills himself.\r\n\r\nSeveral days after Gatsby's murder, his father Henry Gatz arrives for the sparsely attended funeral. After Gatsby's death, Nick comes to hate New York and decides that Gatsby, Daisy, Tom, and he were all Midwesterners unsuited to Eastern life.[d] Nick encounters Tom and initially refuses to shake his hand. Tom admits he was the one who told George that Gatsby owned the vehicle that killed Myrtle. Before returning to the Midwest, Nick returns to Gatsby's mansion and stares across the bay at the green light emanating from the end of Daisy's dock.\r\n\r\n<h2>Critical</h2> <h2>Analysis</h2>\r\n\r\nFollowing the novel's revival, later critical writings on The Great Gatsby focused on Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the American Dream in the hedonistic Jazz Age, a name for the era which Fitzgerald claimed to have coined. In 1970, scholar Roger L. Pearson asserted that Fitzgerald's work - more so than other twentieth century novels - is especially linked with this conceptualization of the American dream. Pearson traced the literary origins of this dream to Colonial America. The dream is the belief that every individual, regardless of their origins, may seek and achieve their desired goals, \"be they political, monetary, or social. It is the literary expression of the concept of America: The land of opportunity\".\r\n\r\nScholars and writers commonly ascribe Gatsby's inability to achieve the American Dream to entrenched class disparities in American society. The novel underscores the limits of the American lower class to transcend their station of birth. Scholar Sarah Churchwell contends that Fitzgerald's novel is a tale of class warfare in a status-obsessed country that refuses to acknowledge publicly it even has a class system.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 11,\r\n    name: \"Revenge, love, and power\",\r\n    points: 7,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that he wrote in the rhythm of a heartbeat.</i><br/><br/>A hint is available at a cost of 2 points.</div>),\r\n    answer: \"William Shakespeare\",\r\n    article: `\r\nWilliam Shakespeare was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" or simply \"the Bard\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\r\n\r\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford - upon - Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592 he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part - owner (\"sharer\") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613) he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.\r\n\r\nShakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.\r\n\r\nMany of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying quality and accuracy during his lifetime. However, in 1623 John Heminges and Henry Condell, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that includes 36 of his plays. Its preface includes a prescient poem by Ben Jonson, a former rival of Shakespeare, who hailed Shakespeare with the now - famous epithet: \"not of an age, but for all time\".\r\n\r\n<h2>Plays</h2>\r\nMost playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career.\r\n\r\nThe first recorded works of Shakespeare are Richard III and the three parts of Henry VI, written in the early 1590s during a vogue for historical drama. Shakespeare's plays are difficult to date precisely, however, and studies of the texts suggest that Titus Andronicus, The Comedy of Errors, The Taming of the Shrew, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona may also belong to Shakespeare's earliest period. His first histories, which draw heavily on the 1587 edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland, dramatise the destructive results of weak or corrupt rule and have been interpreted as a justification for the origins of the Tudor dynasty. The early plays were influenced by the works of other Elizabethan dramatists, especially Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe, by the traditions of medieval drama, and by the plays of Seneca. The Comedy of Errors was also based on classical models, but no source for The Taming of the Shrew has been found, though it has an identical plot but different wording as another play with a similar name. Like The Two Gentlemen of Verona, in which two friends appear to approve of rape, the Shrew's story of the taming of a woman's independent spirit by a man sometimes troubles modern critics, directors, and audiences.\r\n\r\nShakespeare's early classical and Italianate comedies, containing tight double plots and precise comic sequences, give way in the mid - 1590s to the romantic atmosphere of his most acclaimed comedies. A Midsummer Night's Dream is a witty mixture of romance, fairy magic, and comic lowlife scenes. Shakespeare's next comedy, the equally romantic The Merchant of Venice, contains a portrayal of the vengeful Jewish moneylender Shylock, which reflects dominant Elizabethan views but may appear derogatory to modern audiences. The wit and wordplay of Much Ado About Nothing, the charming rural setting of As You Like It, and the lively merrymaking of Twelfth Night complete Shakespeare's sequence of great comedies. After the lyrical Richard II, written almost entirely in verse, Shakespeare introduced prose comedy into the histories of the late 1590s, Henry IV, Part 1 and 2, and Henry V. Henry IV features Falstaff, rogue, wit and friend of Prince Hal. His characters become more complex and tender as he switches deftly between comic and serious scenes, prose and poetry, and achieves the narrative variety of his mature work. This period begins and ends with two tragedies: Romeo and Juliet, the famous romantic tragedy of sexually charged adolescence, love, and death; and Julius Caesar - based on Sir Thomas North's 1579 translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives - which introduced a new kind of drama. According to the Shakespearean scholar James Shapiro, in Julius Caesar, \"the various strands of politics, character, inwardness, contemporary events, even Shakespeare's own reflections on the act of writing, began to infuse each other\".\r\n\r\nIn the early - 17th century, Shakespeare wrote the so-called \"problem plays\" Measure for Measure, Troilus and Cressida, and All's Well That Ends Well and a number of his best known tragedies. Many critics believe that Shakespeare's tragedies represent the peak of his art. Hamlet has probably been analysed more than any other Shakespearean character, especially for his famous soliloquy which begins \"To be or not to be; that is the question\". Unlike the introverted Hamlet, whose fatal flaw is hesitation, Othello and Lear are undone by hasty errors of judgement. The plots of Shakespeare's tragedies often hinge on such fatal errors or flaws, which overturn order and destroy the hero and those he loves. In Othello, Iago stokes Othello's sexual jealousy to the point where he murders the innocent wife who loves him. In King Lear, the old king commits the tragic error of giving up his powers, initiating the events which lead to the torture and blinding of the Earl of Gloucester and the murder of Lear's youngest daughter, Cordelia. According to the critic Frank Kermode, \"the play...offers neither its good characters nor its audience any relief from its cruelty\". In Macbeth, the shortest and most compressed of Shakespeare's tragedies, uncontrollable ambition incites Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, to murder the rightful king and usurp the throne until their own guilt destroys them in turn. In this play, Shakespeare adds a supernatural element to the tragic structure. His last major tragedies, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus, contain some of Shakespeare's finest poetry and were considered his most successful tragedies by the poet and critic T. S. Eliot. Eliot wrote, \"Shakespeare acquired more essential history from Plutarch than most men could from the whole British Museum.\"\r\n\r\nIn his final period, Shakespeare turned to romance or tragicomedy and completed three more major plays: Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest, as well as the collaboration, Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Less bleak than the tragedies, these four plays are graver in tone than the comedies of the 1590s, but they end with reconciliation and the forgiveness of potentially tragic errors. Some commentators have seen this change in mood as evidence of a more serene view of life on Shakespeare's part, but it may merely reflect the theatrical fashion of the day. Shakespeare collaborated on two further surviving plays, Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen, probably with John Fletcher.\r\n    `,\r\n  }, {\r\n    puzzleId: 12,\r\n    name: \"Switch\",\r\n    points: 7,\r\n    body: (<div><i>Historical records indicate that the results were unexpected.</i></div>),\r\n    answer: \"Rick Astley\",\r\n    article: `\r\nRichard Paul Astley (born 6 February 1966) is an English singer, songwriter, radio DJ and podcaster. He gained fame through his association with the production trio Stock Aitken Waterman, releasing the 1987 album Whenever You Need Somebody, which sold 15 million copies worldwide and was certified Platinum by both the BPI and the RIAA. His debut single \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" was a No. 1 hit in more than 25 countries, winning the 1988 Brit Award for Best British Single. The song also stayed at the top of the UK chart for five weeks in 1987 and was the best - selling single of that year. His 1988 single \"Together Forever\" also topped the US Billboard Hot 100 and was one of his eight songs to reach the UK Singles Chart Top 10.\r\n\r\nIn 1988, Astley followed up his debut album with Hold Me in Your Arms which achieved Platinum and Gold certifications internationally. The lead single \"She Wants to Dance with Me\" became a worldwide Top 10 hit. In 1991, he left Stock Aitken Waterman and moved his musical direction towards soul, which he explored on his other albums. His 1991 single \"Cry for Help\" was his last single to reach the Top 10 in either the US or UK. In 1993, he retired from music to focus on spending time with his partner and daughter. He returned to the music industry in 2000 and released 50 to celebrate his 50th birthday in 2016, with the album debuting in the UK at No. 1. His most recent studio album Are We There Yet? was released in 2023.\r\n\r\nAstley has sold approximately 40 million records worldwide and was nominated in 1989 for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist but lost to Tracy Chapman. During the period between his debut release and his fifth single, Astley outsold every other artist in the world. In the United Kingdom, Astley was also in the Top 40 every week for the first six months of his career. He became an internet phenomenon in 2007 following the emergence of the Rickrolling meme, which utilizes the music video for \"Never Gonna Give You Up\", and his career was revitalised by the meme's popularity. A year after the Rickrolling meme began, he was voted \"Best Act Ever\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008. On 28 July 2021, \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" became the fourth 1980s song to reach one billion views on YouTube.\r\n\r\n<h2>Legacy</h2>\r\nIn 2007, Astley became the subject of a viral Internet meme known as rickrolling. The meme is a type of bait and switch using a disguised hyperlink that leads to the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" music video. When victims click on a seemingly unrelated link, the site with the music video loads instead of what was expected and in doing so they are said to have been \"rickrolled\". The meme has also extended to using the song's lyrics in unexpected places. The meme gained mainstream attention in 2008 through several publicized events, particularly when YouTube used it on its 2008 April Fools' Day event. Rickrolling saw a massive resurgence online in the early 2020s. In online classes on Zoom during the worldwide COVID - 19 lockdown, students often rickrolled their classmates and teachers. A 4K remaster of the \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" music video went viral in early 2021.\r\n\r\nInitially, Astley, who had only recently returned to performing after a 10 - year hiatus, was hesitant about using his newfound popularity from the meme to further his career, but accepted the fame when he rickrolled the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade with a surprise performance of the song. Since then, he has seen his performance career revitalised by the meme's popularity. In an interview, Astley stated that one of his favourite rickroll videos is \"BarackRoll\", a rickroll featuring clips from rallies by Barack Obama during his 2008 presidential campaign, edited to make it look as though he is singing \"Never Gonna Give You Up\".\r\n\r\nAstley himself has been rickrolled a few times; the first time pre-dated the viral phenomenon. In an interview with Larry King, Astley says that the first time he fell for the prank was through an email his friend sent him during the early 2000s. On a Reddit post in June 2020, a user claimed to have met Astley backstage when they were 12 years old, but the user posted a link to the song instead of a picture verifying the encounter. Astley later confirmed he had been tricked into clicking the link. The post became the most - upvoted post of 2020 on Reddit.\r\n    `,\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default puzzleInfo;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { NavLink } from \"react-router-dom\";\r\n\r\nimport { withStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\r\nimport Divider from '@material-ui/core/Divider';\r\nimport Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper';\r\nimport Grid from '@material-ui/core/Grid';\r\n\r\nimport styles from './commonStyles.js';\r\nimport puzzleInfo from './puzzleInfo.js';\r\nimport { ThemeContext } from \"./util/config.js\";\r\n\r\nconst MAX_PUZZLES = 12;\r\n\r\nclass Puzzles extends React.Component {\r\n  static contextType = ThemeContext;\r\n\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n\r\n    // Temporary initial perms\r\n    let permsArray = Array(28); // 0th idx is undefined\r\n    permsArray.fill(-1);\r\n    permsArray[0] = -1337;\r\n    permsArray[1] = -1;\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      perms: permsArray,\r\n      receivedToken: false,\r\n      noTeam: false,\r\n      score: -1\r\n    }\r\n    this.puzzlesList = [...Array(12).keys()].map(x => x + 1)\r\n\r\n    // Initialize solve status if not already done\r\n    let solves = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"solves\"));\r\n    if (!solves) {\r\n      solves = new Array(MAX_PUZZLES+1).fill(0);\r\n    }\r\n    localStorage.setItem(\"solves\", JSON.stringify(solves));\r\n    this.state.perms = solves\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.makeRequests();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  componentDidUpdate() {\r\n    this.makeRequests();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  makeRequests = () => {\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  sumPerms = (start, end) => {\r\n    let ans = 0;\r\n    for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {\r\n      ans += this.state.perms[i];\r\n    }\r\n    return ans;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  numAttempts = () => {\r\n    let attempts = new Array(MAX_PUZZLES + 1).fill(0);\r\n    for (var h = 1; h <= MAX_PUZZLES; h++) {\r\n      let stored_progress = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(\"puzzle\" + h));\r\n      attempts[h] = stored_progress ? stored_progress.length : 0;\r\n    }\r\n    attempts.shift();\r\n    return attempts.reduce((x,y)=>x+y) + \" guesses (\" + attempts + \")\"\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { classes } = this.props;\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"Puzzles\">\r\n        <Paper className={classes.paper}>\r\n          <h1>Puzzles</h1>\r\n          <h3>Your score: {puzzleInfo.map((x, i)=> x.points * this.state.perms[i]).reduce((x, y) => x + y)} points \r\n          (Max: {puzzleInfo.map(x=> x.points).reduce((x, y) => x + y)} points) <br/> {this.numAttempts()}</h3>\r\n          <h3></h3>\r\n          <Divider />\r\n            <div className=\"Act1\">\r\n              <br />\r\n              <Grid container spacing={4} style={{ paddingLeft: \"20px\", paddingRight: \"20px\" }}>\r\n                {this.puzzlesList.map((puzzleId) => {\r\n                    return (\r\n                      <Grid item xs={12} sm={6} md={3} key={puzzleId}>\r\n                        <NavLink activeClassName=\"active\" className=\"link\" to={\"/puzzles/\" + puzzleId}>\r\n                        <button className={this.state.perms[puzzleId] === 1 ? \"ctfbutton ctfbuttonsolved\" : \"ctfbutton ctfbuttonunsolved\"}>\r\n                          #{puzzleId}: {puzzleInfo[puzzleId].name}\r\n                          <br /><br />\r\n                          {puzzleInfo[puzzleId].points}\r\n                        </button>\r\n                        </NavLink>\r\n                      </Grid>\r\n                    )\r\n              })}\r\n              </Grid>\r\n              <br />\r\n            </div>\r\n        </Paper>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default withStyles(styles)(Puzzles);","import React from 'react';\r\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\r\nimport { makeStyles } from '@material-ui/core/styles';\r\nimport Table from '@material-ui/core/Table';\r\nimport TableBody from '@material-ui/core/TableBody';\r\nimport TableCell from '@material-ui/core/TableCell';\r\nimport TableContainer from '@material-ui/core/TableContainer';\r\nimport TableHead from '@material-ui/core/TableHead';\r\nimport TablePagination from '@material-ui/core/TablePagination';\r\nimport TableRow from '@material-ui/core/TableRow';\r\nimport Paper from '@material-ui/core/Paper';\r\n\r\nfunction descendingComparator(a, b, orderBy) {\r\n  if (b[orderBy] < a[orderBy]) {\r\n    return -1;\r\n  }\r\n  if (b[orderBy] > a[orderBy]) {\r\n    return 1;\r\n  }\r\n  return 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getComparator(order, orderBy) {\r\n  return order === 'desc'\r\n    ?
